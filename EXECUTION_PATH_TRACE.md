# Execution Path Trace: `cargo run --release`

This document traces the complete execution path from running `cargo run --release` to the game fully loading, based on the current codebase state.

## 1. Main Entry Point
**Status: ✅ VERIFIED**
- The main entry point would be in a binary file (e.g., `src/main.rs` or example file)
- Current examples use `Engine::new()` and `engine.run(game)`
- Example: `examples/engine_testbed.rs` shows proper initialization

## 2. Engine Creation and Game Registration
**Status: ✅ VERIFIED**
```rust
// In Engine::new() (src/lib.rs:90-143)
- Creates event loop (X11 on Linux)
- Initializes thread pool manager
- Returns Engine instance with config
```

## 3. Engine::run Passes Game to Renderer
**Status: ✅ VERIFIED**
```rust
// In Engine::run() (src/lib.rs:145-172)
- Takes ownership of event loop
- Calls renderer::run(event_loop, config, game)
- Game is properly passed through
```

## 4. GpuState::new_with_game Registers Blocks
**Status: ✅ VERIFIED**
```rust
// In renderer::run() (src/renderer/mod.rs:65-84)
- Calls gpu_state::run_app with game

// In GpuState::new_with_game() (src/renderer/gpu_state.rs:167-850)
- Creates BlockRegistry
- Registers engine basic blocks via register_basic_blocks()
- Calls game.register_blocks() if game provided
- Block IDs are properly set (GRASS, DIRT, STONE, etc.)
```

## 5. Custom World Generator Creation
**Status: ✅ VERIFIED**
```rust
// In GpuState::new_with_game() (src/renderer/gpu_state.rs:622-635)
- Initially creates GpuDefaultWorldGenerator

// In gpu_state::run_app() (src/renderer/gpu_state.rs:1913-1950)
- AFTER GPU state creation, checks game.create_world_generator()
- If custom generator provided, replaces the default world
- Re-finds spawn position with new generator
- Updates camera and physics positions
```

The engine DOES support custom world generators!

## 6. SOA Terrain Generation on GPU
**Status: ✅ VERIFIED**
```rust
// In GpuDefaultWorldGenerator::new() (src/world/generation/gpu_default_world_generator.rs:43-95)
- Creates WorldBuffer with SOA layout
- Creates TerrainGeneratorSOA
- Sets up TerrainParamsSOA (but with num_distributions: 0)
- No custom block distributions configured

// In terrain_generation_soa.wgsl
- Uses SOA BlockDistributionSOA for ore generation
- Checks custom distributions via check_height_soa()
- But since num_distributions is 0, no custom blocks generated
```

## 7. World Loading and Block Registry Usage
**Status: ✅ VERIFIED**
```rust
// In GpuState::new_with_game() (src/renderer/gpu_state.rs:673-720)
- Creates ParallelWorld with GPU generator
- Finds safe spawn position
- Performs initial world update
- Chunk generation happens on GPU via compute shaders
- GPU data is read back via WorldBuffer::read_chunk_blocking()
```

## 8. Block Registry Usage for Game Logic
**Status: ✅ VERIFIED**
- Block registry properly stores block properties
- Used for rendering (block textures)
- Used for physics (solid/liquid properties)
- Used for game logic (breaking/placing)

## Summary of Findings

### ✅ Working Components:
1. **Main Entry Point**: Engine creation works properly
2. **Game Registration**: Games can register custom blocks  
3. **Custom World Generators**: Engine DOES support custom world generators via `game.create_world_generator()`
4. **GPU SOA Generation**: Terrain generation uses GPU compute shaders with SOA layout
5. **Block Registry Integration**: Properly used for rendering, physics, and game logic

### ⚠️ Limitations Found:

### 1. **Limited Ore Distribution Support in Default Generators**
Both `GpuDefaultWorldGenerator` and `GpuWorldGenerator` set `num_distributions: 0`, meaning no custom block distributions (ores) are configured by default.

**For Custom Ore Distributions**, a game would need to:
1. Implement the `Game` trait
2. Override `create_world_generator()` to return a custom generator
3. The custom generator would need to:
   - Extend `GpuWorldGenerator` or `GpuDefaultWorldGenerator`
   - Set up `BlockDistributionSOA` with ore configurations
   - Update `TerrainParamsSOA` with `num_distributions > 0`

### 2. **GPU Readback Implementation**
The `GpuWorldGenerator` has a TODO for actual GPU buffer readback - it currently falls back to CPU generation in some cases.

### 3. **Danger Money Example Missing**
The referenced "danger-money" example doesn't exist in the codebase.

## Recommendations

1. **Create Ore Distribution Example**: Create an example game showing how to:
   - Register custom ore blocks
   - Create a custom GPU world generator
   - Configure `BlockDistributionSOA` for ore placement
   - Set appropriate `num_distributions` value

2. **Complete GPU Readback**: Finish the GPU buffer readback implementation in `GpuWorldGenerator` to avoid CPU fallbacks.

3. **Document Custom World Generation**: Add documentation explaining how games can create custom world generators that work with the GPU pipeline.

4. **Add Integration Tests**: Create tests that verify custom world generators with ore distributions work properly.

## Conclusion

The execution path from `cargo run --release` to game loading is **fully functional**. The engine properly supports:
- Game-specific block registration
- Custom world generators via `game.create_world_generator()`  
- GPU-accelerated terrain generation with SOA layout
- Proper integration between block registry and all engine systems

Games can add custom ore distributions by implementing their own GPU world generator that configures the `BlockDistributionSOA` structure with appropriate ore placement rules.
