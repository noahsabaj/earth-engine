# Earth Engine

A state-of-the-art voxel game engine built with Rust, designed to push the boundaries of what's possible with voxel technology through data-oriented design and GPU-first architecture.

## üöÄ Features

- **12x faster** chunk generation through parallelization
- **GPU-first architecture** with data-oriented design
- **Thread-safe** concurrent systems
- **Modern rendering** with wgpu (Vulkan/DirectX/Metal)
- **Planet-scale worlds** with efficient streaming
- **Cross-platform** - Native (Windows/Linux/Mac) + Web (WebAssembly)

## üìã Current Status

**Sprint 16 Complete** - Parallel Lighting System ‚úÖ

See [MASTER_ROADMAP.md](MASTER_ROADMAP.md) for full development timeline.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Earth Engine uses a revolutionary data-oriented architecture where:
- Systems don't know about each other - they read/write shared memory
- GPU computes stay on GPU - no unnecessary transfers
- "The best system is no system" philosophy

See [DATA_ORIENTED_TRANSITION_PLAN.md](DATA_ORIENTED_TRANSITION_PLAN.md) for details.

## üéÆ Vision

Building the first voxel engine that truly uses modern hardware. Not competing with Minecraft - competing with what Minecraft COULD have been if built in 2025.

See [EARTH_ENGINE_VISION_2025.md](EARTH_ENGINE_VISION_2025.md) for the revolutionary game design.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/earth-engine.git
cd earth-engine

# Build the engine
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run GPU detection test
cargo run --bin gpu_test
```

### Development Workflow
1. Develop in WSL/Linux environment
2. Sync to Windows for GPU testing using `sync_to_windows.sh`
3. See [ENVIRONMENT_COHERENCE.md](ENVIRONMENT_COHERENCE.md) for details

- Begin data-oriented transition

## üìà Performance

| System | Original | Current | Target |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| Chunk Generation | 10.40s | 0.85s (12x) | 0.008s (1300x) |
| Mesh Building | 2.89s | 0.55s (5x) | 0.005s (580x) |
| Lighting | N/A | 0.30s | 0.003s (100x) |
