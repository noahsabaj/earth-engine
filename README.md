# Earth Engine

**Version: 0.35.0** ([Versioning Strategy](docs/VERSIONING.md))

A state-of-the-art voxel game engine built with Rust, designed to push the boundaries of what's possible with voxel technology through data-oriented design and GPU-first architecture.

## üöÄ Features

- **12x faster** chunk generation through parallelization
- **GPU-first architecture** with data-oriented design
- **Thread-safe** concurrent systems
- **Modern rendering** with wgpu (Vulkan/DirectX/Metal)
- **Planet-scale worlds** with efficient streaming
- **Cross-platform** - Native (Windows/Linux/Mac) + Web (WebAssembly)

## üìã Current Status

**Sprint 35 Complete** - Architecture Finalization ‚úÖ  
**Emergency Sprint Series 35.1-35.5** - In Planning üö®

### Reality Check:
After completing Sprint 35, we conducted a comprehensive code audit that revealed significant gaps between our claims and reality. We are now entering an emergency sprint series focused on **engineering discipline and honesty**.

### What We Claimed vs Reality:
- **Claimed**: "Zero-allocation architecture" | **Reality**: 268 allocations per frame
- **Claimed**: "Complete DOP transition" | **Reality**: 228 files still have OOP patterns  
- **Claimed**: "Production ready" | **Reality**: 8.4% test coverage, 500+ unwrap() calls
- **Claimed**: "All features working" | **Reality**: ~5 features actually work

See:
- [MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md) - Our commitment to honesty and working code
- [RECOVERY_PLAN.md](RECOVERY_PLAN.md) - 10-week emergency sprint plan
- [docs/](docs/README.md) - All documentation (now organized!)
- [docs/status/CURRENT.md](docs/status/CURRENT.md) - Current emergency status
- [docs/MASTER_ROADMAP.md](docs/MASTER_ROADMAP.md) - Full development timeline

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current State - Emergency Recovery Mode

### What Actually Works (Verified):
- ‚úÖ Basic camera movement (with allocations)
- ‚úÖ Simple chunk rendering (not optimized)
- ‚úÖ Block placement (sometimes crashes)
- ‚úÖ Some parallel systems (with race conditions)
- ‚úÖ Shader compilation (when lucky)

### What Doesn't Work (Honest Truth):
- ‚ùå "Zero-allocation" - allocates 268 times per frame
- ‚ùå "Data-oriented" - 228 files still use OOP
- ‚ùå "Production ready" - panics on bad input
- ‚ùå "GPU-first" - most computation still on CPU
- ‚ùå Web implementation - abandoned due to no real value
- ‚ùå Most claimed optimizations - not actually implemented
- ‚ùå Test coverage - only 8.4%

### Emergency Sprint Plan (10 weeks):
1. **Weeks 1-2**: Remove all panic points, establish honest metrics
2. **Weeks 3-4**: Actually implement DOP, prove zero allocations
3. **Weeks 5-6**: Make core features work reliably
4. **Weeks 7-8**: Integration testing, real benchmarks
5. **Weeks 9-10**: B-grade certification, honest documentation

**Brutal Honesty**: We built impressive architecture but failed at basic engineering discipline. The next 10 weeks focus on making things actually work. No new features. No hype. Just engineering.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Earth Engine uses a revolutionary data-oriented architecture where:
- Systems don't know about each other - they read/write shared memory
- GPU computes stay on GPU - no unnecessary transfers
- "The best system is no system" philosophy

See [docs/DATA_ORIENTED_TRANSITION_PLAN.md](docs/DATA_ORIENTED_TRANSITION_PLAN.md) for details.

## üéÆ Vision

Building the first voxel engine that truly uses modern hardware. Not competing with Minecraft - competing with what Minecraft COULD have been if built in 2025.

See [docs/EARTH_ENGINE_VISION_2025.md](docs/EARTH_ENGINE_VISION_2025.md) for the revolutionary game design.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/earth-engine.git
cd earth-engine

# Build the engine
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run GPU detection test
cargo run --bin gpu_test
```

### Development Workflow
1. Develop in WSL/Linux environment
2. Sync to Windows for GPU testing using `sync_to_windows.sh`
3. See [docs/ENVIRONMENT_COHERENCE.md](docs/ENVIRONMENT_COHERENCE.md) for details

## üìà Performance (Reality Check)

| System | Claimed | Actual | Honest Target |
|--------|---------|--------|---------------|
| Chunk Generation | 0.008s | 0.85s | 0.1s |
| Allocations/Frame | 0 | 268 | 0 |
| Test Coverage | 95% | 8.4% | 60% |
| OOP Files | 0 | 228 | 0 |
| Panic Points | 0 | 500+ | 0 |
| Working Features | 50+ | ~5 | 20+ |

**Note**: Previous performance claims were aspirational. These are real measurements.
