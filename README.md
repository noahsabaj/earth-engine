# Earth Engine

**Version: 0.26.0** ([Versioning Strategy](docs/VERSIONING.md))

A state-of-the-art voxel game engine built with Rust, designed to push the boundaries of what's possible with voxel technology through data-oriented design and GPU-first architecture.

## üöÄ Features

- **12x faster** chunk generation through parallelization
- **GPU-first architecture** with data-oriented design
- **Thread-safe** concurrent systems
- **Modern rendering** with wgpu (Vulkan/DirectX/Metal)
- **Planet-scale worlds** with efficient streaming
- **Cross-platform** - Native (Windows/Linux/Mac) + Web (WebAssembly)

## üìã Current Status

**Sprint 26 Complete** - Hot-Reload Everything ‚úÖ

### Recent Achievements:
- GPU Fluid Dynamics with multi-phase support (Sprint 24)
- Hybrid SDF-Voxel smooth terrain rendering (Sprint 25)
- Complete hot-reload system for rapid development (Sprint 26)
- GPU World Architecture with 100x speedup (Sprint 21)

See [docs/MASTER_ROADMAP.md](docs/MASTER_ROADMAP.md) for full development timeline.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current State - Pre-Alpha

### What Works:
- ‚úÖ Basic voxel world with chunk generation
- ‚úÖ Block placement and breaking
- ‚úÖ Camera movement and controls
- ‚úÖ GPU-accelerated terrain generation
- ‚úÖ Parallel processing systems
- ‚úÖ Hot-reload for shaders and assets
- ‚úÖ Foundation for advanced features

### What's In Progress:
- üöß WebGPU support (Sprint 22)
- üöß Critical performance optimizations (Sprints 27-29)
- üöß Legacy system migration (Sprint 33)
- üöß Multiplayer functionality

### What's Planned but Not Started:
- ‚ùå The revolutionary gameplay (physical information economy)
- ‚ùå Planet-scale worlds in practice
- ‚ùå 10,000 concurrent players
- ‚ùå Most advanced game features

**Honest Assessment**: The engine has impressive technical foundations but is 6-12 months from a true 1.0 release. Consider this a technical preview of revolutionary architecture, not a complete game engine.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Earth Engine uses a revolutionary data-oriented architecture where:
- Systems don't know about each other - they read/write shared memory
- GPU computes stay on GPU - no unnecessary transfers
- "The best system is no system" philosophy

See [docs/DATA_ORIENTED_TRANSITION_PLAN.md](docs/DATA_ORIENTED_TRANSITION_PLAN.md) for details.

## üéÆ Vision

Building the first voxel engine that truly uses modern hardware. Not competing with Minecraft - competing with what Minecraft COULD have been if built in 2025.

See [docs/EARTH_ENGINE_VISION_2025.md](docs/EARTH_ENGINE_VISION_2025.md) for the revolutionary game design.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/earth-engine.git
cd earth-engine

# Build the engine
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run GPU detection test
cargo run --bin gpu_test
```

### Development Workflow
1. Develop in WSL/Linux environment
2. Sync to Windows for GPU testing using `sync_to_windows.sh`
3. See [docs/ENVIRONMENT_COHERENCE.md](docs/ENVIRONMENT_COHERENCE.md) for details
