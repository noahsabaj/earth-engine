# Hearth Engine System Audit

## Overview
This audit examines the Hearth Engine's core systems to identify functional vs stubbed/placeholder implementations as of the current codebase state.

## Testing Infrastructure

### Working Examples:

- `engine_testbed.rs` - Comprehensive testing platform
- `physics_integration_demo.rs` - Physics system testing
- GPU-specific tests for terrain, culling, driven rendering

### Test Coverage:
- World generation tests
- GPU compute tests
- Physics integration tests
- Renderer component tests

## Critical Dependencies

### Functional:
- wgpu (0.19) - Graphics API
- winit (0.29) - Window management
- cgmath/glam - Math operations
- rayon - Parallel processing
- dashmap - Concurrent data structures

### Platform Support:
- Native builds fully supported
- Web/WASM support removed
- Linux/X11 specific code for WSL compatibility

## Summary

### Fully Functional Systems:
1. Core engine initialization and event loop
2. World generation and chunk management
3. Basic renderer with GPU-driven pipeline
4. Physics with GPU acceleration
5. Input handling
6. Camera system
7. Lighting propagation
8. Block registry and management

### Partially Functional:
1. ECS (structures only, no systems)
2. Persistence (basic save/load)
3. Fluid simulation (shaders but unclear integration)
4. SDF terrain (implemented but not integrated)

### Stubbed/Missing:
1. Networking (extensive planning, no implementation)
2. Main Renderer struct (uses gpu_state directly)
3. Advanced UI systems
4. Inventory/Crafting (data structures only)
5. Particles (data structures, unclear integration)
6. Weather (GPU shaders exist, integration unclear)

### Key Findings:
- The engine has a solid foundation with core systems working
- Heavy focus on GPU compute and data-oriented design
- Many advanced features are planned but not implemented
- The codebase is actively transitioning from OOP to DOP
- Good test coverage for implemented features

### Recommendation for Testing:
The engine is ready for basic testing with:
- World generation and rendering
- Player movement and physics
- Block placement/breaking
- Basic lighting
- Camera controls

Advanced features like networking, crafting, and particles would need implementation work before testing.
