# Hearth Engine Performance Claims Audit

**Date**: June 15, 2025  
**Auditor**: Documentation Auditor  
**Context**: Based on validation results revealing 0.8 FPS issue and hardware-specific claims

## Executive Summary

This audit catalogs all performance claims found in Hearth Engine documentation and categorizes them based on verification status. The audit was triggered by the discovery that some performance claims are hardware-specific but presented as universal, and that the 0.8 FPS issue contradicts many performance claims.

## Claim Categories

- **VERIFIED**: Proven true by tests with evidence
- **MISLEADING**: True but lacks context (e.g., hardware-specific)
- **FALSE**: Demonstrably incorrect
- **UNTESTED**: Cannot verify without more information

## Summary of Findings

### Verified Claims (True)
1. 12.2x speedup for parallel chunk generation ✅
2. 5.3x speedup for parallel mesh building ✅
3. 1.73-2.55x DOP performance improvements ✅
4. 99.99% allocation reduction with pre-allocated pools ✅
5. Cache efficiency improvements (2.7x bandwidth) ✅

### Misleading Claims (Need Context)
1. "100x faster GPU operations" - only for specific kernels
2. "95% cache hit rate" - only for sequential access patterns
3. "100x less CPU overhead" - only for draw calls, not overall
4. "~45 FPS" - was true, now 0.8 FPS due to regression

### False Claims (Need Correction)
1. 1000+ FPS claimed, actual 0.8 FPS ❌
2. 16.7x faster frame times - no evidence ❌
3. 100-1000x overall performance gains - actual 2-5x ❌
4. 10,000 concurrent players - cannot run 1 at good FPS ❌
5. 240+ FPS target - currently 0.8 FPS ❌
6. 144+ FPS performance - currently 0.8 FPS ❌
7. 0.008s chunk generation - actual 0.85s ❌
8. 500MB RAM usage - actual 2.3GB ❌

### Untested Claims (Need Verification)
1. 100K+ objects capability
2. 50,000 visible chunks
3. Planet-scale worlds
4. GPU-to-GPU networking performance

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update all FPS claims** to reflect 0.8 FPS reality
2. **Remove 100-1000x claims** - use verified 2-5x instead
3. **Add hardware context** to all performance claims
4. **Mark untested features** as "planned" or "architectural capability"
5. **Create benchmarks** before making performance claims

### Documentation Standards Going Forward
1. Every performance claim must include:
   - Benchmark methodology
   - Hardware specifications
   - Reproducible test code
   - Actual measurements (not estimates)
   
2. Use clear language:
   - "Measured": For verified benchmarks
   - "Estimated": For calculations without tests
   - "Target": For goals not yet achieved
   - "Architectural capability": For untested design features

3. Regular performance audits:
   - Re-run benchmarks after major changes
   - Update documentation when performance changes
   - Track performance regressions
   - Remove outdated claims

## Critical Finding

The 0.8 FPS issue indicates a fundamental performance problem that invalidates most FPS-related claims. This should be the #1 priority before any new performance claims are made.

## Conclusion

Hearth Engine has made real performance improvements (2-5x in specific areas) but has drastically overclaimed its capabilities. The documentation contains a mix of verified improvements, hardware-specific results presented as universal, and aspirational goals presented as current reality. A comprehensive documentation update is needed to restore credibility and set realistic expectations.
