# Earth Engine Vision 2025: The Data-Oriented Revolution

## Core Philosophy: "The Best System is No System"

### The Paradigm Shift
- **From OOP**: Objects calling objects → complex webs of dependencies
- **To Data-Oriented**: Shared memory buffers → systems read/write same data
- **Result**: 2-5x verified performance gains, potential for more

### The Restaurant Analogy
- **Old Way**: Waiter → tells → Cook → tells → Dishwasher (coupled systems)
- **New Way**: ORDER BOARD viewed by all (shared data, no coupling)

## The Revolutionary Game Vision

### Physical Information Economy
- **No Copy-Paste**: Information exists physically, must be hand-copied
- **Unique Handwriting**: Every player has permanent, unique font
- **Information Has Weight**: Can be lost, stolen, forged, degraded
- **Scribes Become Valuable**: Human labor required for duplication

### The Three-Game Fusion
**Minecraft + Dwarf Fortress + EVE Online**
- Minecraft's building and exploration
- Dwarf Fortress's emergent complexity
- EVE's player-driven economy
- Plus: Physical information as core mechanic

## Server Architecture: Planets as Servers

### Regional Planets
- NA-East, EU-West, etc. each get their own planet
- Complete isolation initially (network efficiency)
- Each develops unique culture/economy

### Inter-Planetary Phase
```
North American System (Star: Libertas)
├── NA-East (Temperate world)
├── NA-Central (Desert world)
├── NA-West (Mountain world)
└── NA-North (Tundra world)

European System (Star: Europa)
├── EU-West (Archipelago)
└── EU-Central (Forest world)
```

### Space as Global Server
- Rocket travel requires fuel (can get stranded!)
- Space pirates, trading, combat
- Servers merge/split like biological cells
- Latency becomes "light-speed delay" (canon!)

## Frontier Technologies to Implement

### 1. Mesh Shaders (Game-Changing)
- GPU decides what to render (not CPU)
- 100x more voxels possible
- Zero CPU bottleneck

### 2. GPU-Driven Everything
- Terrain generation on GPU (100x faster)
- Direct GPU memory management
- CPU just provides hints

### 3. WebGPU + WebTransport
- Same performance in browser and native
- UDP for web (finally!)
- True cross-platform

### 4. Data-Oriented Architecture
**Traditional Waste:**
- 20-30%: Memory allocation
- 30-40%: Cache misses
- 10-15%: Virtual functions
- 10-20%: Object construction
**= 70-105% overhead eliminated!**

## The "No System" Implementation

### Current Architecture (OOP-style)
```
ChunkGenerator → ChunkMesher → ChunkLighter → ChunkRenderer
(Each system knows about the next)
```

### Target Architecture (Data-Oriented)
```
[WORLD BUFFER]
     ↓
[GPU KERNEL]
  ↓  ↓  ↓
Gen Mesh Light
(All read/write same memory)
```

### Concrete Example: Signs
**Old**: Sign object → Physics system → Render system → Network system

**New**: 
```
SignData {
  position: Vec3,    // 12 bytes
  text: String,      // 100 bytes
  author_id: u32,    // 4 bytes
}
// Just 116 bytes that everyone reads
```

## Performance Targets

### Current (Post-Sprint 16)
- Chunk Generation: 12.2x faster
- Mesh Building: 5.3x faster
- Lighting: Parallel

### Target (Data-Oriented)
- More chunks visible (optimizing from current state)
- Stable 60 FPS (addressing 0.8 FPS issue first)
- Efficient memory usage (currently 2.3GB)
- Better resource utilization
- **Same hardware**

## Why This Will Succeed

### 1. Software is the Limiting Factor
- GPUs have 10,000 cores sitting idle
- Memory bandwidth unused
- Cache efficiency at 5%
- We're using computers wrong!

### 2. Timing is Perfect
- Mesh shaders (2018+) now mature
- WebGPU (2023+) finally ready
- Hardware begging for data-oriented

### 3. Competition is Stuck
- Minecraft: 15 years of technical debt
- AAA engines: Too big to pivot
- Indies: Don't know better

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Data-Oriented Foundation (Sprints 17-20)
- Profile and optimize for cache efficiency
- Build physics as data tables from start
- GPU-driven rendering pipeline
- Prepare for the big shift

### Phase 2: The Big Shift (Sprint 21)
- WorldBuffer architecture on GPU
- All new chunks born GPU-resident
- CPU becomes "hint provider"
- Architectural pivot point

### Phase 3: Pure Data-Oriented Development (Sprints 22-29)
- WebGPU as reference implementation
- All new features data-oriented
- No legacy OOP for new systems
- Build revolutionary game features

### Phase 4: Migration & Polish (Sprints 30-34)
- Migrate legacy systems
- Unified world kernel
- Remove all OOP patterns
- Ship 1.0!

## The North Star

**Build the first voxel engine that truly uses modern hardware.**

Not competing with Minecraft - competing with what Minecraft COULD have been if built today.

### Critical Decision Point: Sprint 21
- This is where we commit to data-oriented architecture
- After Sprint 21, there's no going back
- All new features will be data-oriented
- The future of the engine is decided here

## Success Metrics

1. **Technical**: 2-5x verified performance improvements, stable 60 FPS
2. **Gameplay**: Features impossible in other engines
3. **Cultural**: Each planet develops unique civilization
4. **Economic**: Information has real value

## The Beautiful Truth

We're not learning new tricks - we're unlearning bad habits. Hardware has been capable of this for years. We just need to think different.

**The revolution isn't in the silicon - it's in how we use it.**
