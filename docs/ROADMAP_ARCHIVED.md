# ARCHIVED - Original Earth Engine Roadmap

**⚠️ This document is archived and superseded by [MASTER_ROADMAP.md](../MASTER_ROADMAP.md)**

## Archive Note
This was the original roadmap for Earth Engine through Sprint 12. At Sprint 13, the project underwent a major pivot from traditional game features to revolutionary performance optimization through parallelization and data-oriented design.

The original plans for Sprints 13-15 were:
- Sprint 13: Audio System
- Sprint 14: Advanced Features  
- Sprint 15: Performance & Polish

These were replaced with:
- Sprint 13: Thread-Safe Architecture
- Sprint 14: Parallel Chunk Generation
- Sprint 15: Async Mesh Building Pipeline
- Sprint 16+: Continued performance revolution

This pivot was driven by the realization that we could achieve 100-1000x performance gains by fundamentally rethinking how voxel engines use modern hardware.
