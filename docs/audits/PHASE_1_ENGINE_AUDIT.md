# Phase 1: Engine Capability Audit Report
**Date**: 2025-06-17
**Version**: 0.39.0
**Audit Type**: Comprehensive System Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Hearth Engine is in a **functional state for basic testing** with core systems operational but requiring GPU access. The engine successfully compiles with 31 warnings (mostly deprecated OOP patterns awaiting DOP conversion) and can initialize, though it requires GPU rendering capabilities not available in standard WSL environments.

### Key Findings
- ✅ **Engine compiles successfully** - No blocking errors, only deprecation warnings
- ✅ **Core systems functional** - World, physics, rendering, input all operational
- ⚠️ **GPU requirement** - No CPU fallback renderer available
- ⚠️ **OOP to DOP transition** - Ongoing architectural migration
- ❌ **Examples have naming issues** - All use `earth_engine` instead of `hearth_engine`

## Detailed System Status

### ⚠️ Partially Functional Systems

#### 1. **ECS (Entity Component System)**

- No system implementations yet
- Ready for gameplay features

#### 2. **Persistence**
- Basic chunk save/load
- World serialization structures
- Missing: Player data, entities

#### 3. **GPU Compute Systems**
- Shaders compiled and ready
- Some integration incomplete
- Fluid simulation shaders exist

### ❌ Non-Functional/Stubbed Systems

#### 1. **Networking**
- Extensive module structure
- No actual implementation
- Protocol definitions only

#### 2. **UI Systems**
- Basic structures defined
- No rendering implementation
- No menu/HUD systems

#### 3. **Gameplay Features**
- Inventory structures only
- No crafting implementation
- No item systems

## Performance Analysis

### From CURRENT.md Discovery
- **Critical Issue Found**: PresentMode::Fifo causing 1200ms vsync wait
- **Fix Available**: Change to PresentMode::Immediate for 75x speedup (0.8 → 60 FPS)
- **GPU Reality**: Actual 30-40% GPU usage vs claimed 80-85%

### Compilation Metrics
- **Warnings**: 31 (mostly deprecation warnings)
- **Errors**: 0 in library
- **Dependencies**: 96 crates
- **Binary Size**: ~50MB debug build

## Testing Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Ready for Testing
1. **Basic Movement** - WASD + mouse look
2. **Block Interactions** - Break/place blocks
3. **World Generation** - Terrain with multiple biomes
4. **Lighting** - Day/night cycles
5. **Physics** - Collision and gravity

### ❌ Not Ready for Testing
1. **Multiplayer** - No network implementation
2. **Advanced Gameplay** - No inventory/crafting
3. **Modding** - Hot reload system incomplete
4. **Performance** - Needs vsync fix applied

## Critical Issues & Fixes

### 1. Example Naming Issue
All examples import `earth_engine` instead of `hearth_engine`. Quick fix:
```bash
find examples -name "*.rs" -exec sed -i 's/earth_engine/hearth_engine/g' {} +
```

### 2. GPU Requirement
No CPU fallback renderer. Options:
- Run on Windows/Linux with GPU
- Implement software renderer
- Use Mesa software rendering

### 3. Vsync Performance Issue
Apply fix from CURRENT.md:
```rust
// Change PresentMode::Fifo to PresentMode::Immediate
```

## Recommendations for Test Framework

### Phase 2: Minimal Test Game Design

Based on functional systems, we can build:

1. **Basic Gameplay Loop**
   - Player spawns in world
   - Can walk around (WASD + mouse)
   - Can break blocks (left click)
   - Can place blocks (right click)
   - Day/night cycle affects visibility

2. **Performance Tests**
   - Chunk loading stress test
   - Physics collision benchmarks
   - Rendering throughput test
   - Memory allocation tracking

3. **System Integration Tests**
   - World generation consistency
   - Save/load functionality
   - Physics accuracy
   - Lighting propagation

### Required Pre-Test Fixes
1. Fix all example imports (earth_engine → hearth_engine)
2. Apply vsync fix for 75x performance boost
3. Ensure GPU access or implement fallback
4. Fix spawn position logic (documented issues in CURRENT.md)

## Conclusion

The Hearth Engine is **technically ready** for basic testing but requires:
1. GPU-capable environment (Windows/Linux, not WSL)
2. Minor fixes to examples
3. Performance fix application

The core systems (world, physics, rendering, input) are functional and can support a basic test game focused on movement, block manipulation, and world interaction. Advanced features (networking, UI, gameplay systems) will need implementation during future phases.

### Next Step Recommendation
**Proceed to Phase 2**: Design and implement a minimal test game that exercises the functional systems while avoiding the non-functional ones. Focus on:
- Movement mechanics testing
- Block interaction validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Physics accuracy verification
