# Testing Documentation

This directory contains testing strategies, guidelines, and methodologies for the Hearth Engine project.

## Purpose

- Define testing standards and practices
- Document testing strategies for DOP systems
- Provide testing guidelines and patterns
- Track test coverage goals and progress
- Establish verification processes

## What Belongs Here

- Testing strategy documents
- Test writing guidelines
- Coverage requirements
- Testing patterns for DOP
- Integration testing approaches
- Performance testing methodology
- Stress testing procedures

## What Doesn't Belong Here

- Actual test code (lives with source)
- Performance results (see `/docs/performance/`)
- Example code (see `/docs/examples/`)
- API documentation (see `/docs/api/`)

## Testing Philosophy

Testing in a Data-Oriented system focuses on:
- Data transformation correctness
- Buffer state validation
- Kernel output verification
- Performance regression prevention
- System integration validation
- Error propagation testing

## Key Testing Areas

- Unit tests for individual kernels
- Integration tests for system coordination
- Performance benchmarks
- Stress tests for concurrent access
- Error injection testing
- Network simulation testing
- GPU kernel verification
