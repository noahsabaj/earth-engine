## Conclusion

The codebase is well-prepared for Sprint 21. The compute infrastructure, data-oriented patterns, and GPU-driven systems provide a solid foundation. The main challenges are algorithmic (porting noise functions) rather than architectural. With the recommended phased approach, the transition to GPU-resident worlds should be smooth and deliver the expected 100x+ performance improvements.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Sprint 21 as planned. Start with simple implementations and iterate toward complexity.
