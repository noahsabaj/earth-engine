  - Liquid: Water splash, Lava spark, Bubbles
- **Emitter System**: Configurable emitters with various shapes:
  - Point, Sphere, Box, Cone, Cylinder, Line, Disc
- **Particle Physics**: Gravity, drag, wind effects, collisions
- **Effect Presets**: Pre-configured effects for common scenarios

### 4. Biome System
- **30+ Biome Types**: Including:
  - Temperate: Plains, Forest, Birch Forest, Dark Forest, Swamp
  - Cold: Taiga, Snowy Taiga, Ice Plains, Frozen River
  - Warm: Desert, Savanna, Jungle, Badlands
  - Mountain: Various mountain biomes
  - Ocean: Multiple ocean variants
  - Special: Mushroom Island, Cave biomes
- **Biome Properties**:
  - Climate (temperature, humidity)
  - Surface and subsurface blocks
  - Vegetation density
  - Mob spawn rates
  - Unique colors (grass, foliage, water, sky)
- **Biome Generation**:
  - Temperature and humidity based selection
  - Smooth transitions between biomes
  - Height-based terrain modifications
- **Biome Decorations**:
  - Trees, grass, flowers
  - Biome-specific features (cacti, mushrooms, vines)
  - Ore generation with biome considerations

### 5. Integration Features
- Weather affects lighting and visibility
- Biomes influence weather patterns
- Time of day affects ambient lighting and sky color
- Particle effects respond to weather (wind, precipitation)

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Modular design with separate systems for weather, time, particles, and biomes
- Event-driven updates for synchronization
- Efficient particle pooling and culling
- Noise-based procedural generation for biomes

### Key Components
1. **Weather Module** (`weather/`)
   - WeatherSystem: Main weather controller
   - PrecipitationSystem: Manages rain/snow particles
   - WindSystem: Global wind effects
   - FogSettings: Visibility and atmosphere

2. **Time Module** (`time/`)
   - DayNightCycle: Time progression manager
   - CelestialBodies: Sun/moon positioning
   - AmbientLight: Dynamic lighting calculations

3. **Particles Module** (`particles/`)
   - ParticleSystem: Main particle manager
   - ParticleEmitter: Spawn and control particles
   - ParticlePhysics: Physics simulation
   - ParticleEffects: Preset configurations

4. **Biome Module** (`biome/`)
   - BiomeMap: World biome distribution
   - BiomeGenerator: Terrain generation
   - BiomeDecorator: Feature placement
   - BiomeProperties: Biome characteristics

## Testing
- Unit tests for all major components
- Biome generation validation
- Weather transition testing
- Particle system performance tests

## Performance Considerations
- Particle limit system (configurable max particles)
- LOD system for distant weather effects
- Efficient biome caching
- Chunk-based decoration generation

## Future Enhancements
- More weather types (hail, tornadoes)
- Seasonal changes
- Aurora effects for cold biomes
- Volcanic ash for specific biomes
- Advanced water physics for rain
- Weather-based gameplay effects

## Known Issues
- Some compilation warnings remain (mostly unused imports)
- Full testing requires GPU environment
- Performance optimization needed for high particle counts

## Conclusion
Sprint 12 successfully added significant depth to the game world through dynamic environmental systems. The weather, time, particles, and biome systems work together to create a living, breathing world that changes over time and varies by location.
