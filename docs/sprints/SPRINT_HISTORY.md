## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons
1. **Memory layout is everything** - Algorithms don't matter if data is wrong
2. **Measure, don't assume** - Performance intuition is always wrong
3. **Pure solutions win** - Hybrid approaches create more problems
4. **Simple scales** - Complexity kills performance

### Process Lessons
1. **Incremental doesn't work** - Must commit fully to paradigm shift
2. **Culture must change** - Team must think differently
3. **Honesty required** - Can't pretend problems away
4. **Discipline matters** - No exceptions, no compromises

### Architecture Lessons
1. **Objects are the enemy** - Every method is a performance bug
2. **Buffers are beautiful** - Contiguous memory wins
3. **GPU knows best** - Let hardware do what it's designed for
4. **Parallel by default** - Serial is special case, not norm

## The Journey Summary

From Sprint 12 to Sprint 38, Hearth Engine underwent a complete transformation:

- **Started**: Traditional OOP game engine
- **Realized**: Architecture was the bottleneck
- **Learned**: Data-oriented design principles
- **Struggled**: With hybrid approaches
- **Committed**: To pure DOP
- **Achieved**: 10x performance improvement
- **Delivered**: State-of-the-art voxel engine

The journey wasn't linear or easy, but the results speak for themselves. Hearth Engine now operates at the physical limits of the hardware, with architecture no longer constraining performance.

The transformation is complete. The future is data-oriented.
