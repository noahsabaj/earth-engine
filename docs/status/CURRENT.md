## Recent Updates

### CLAUDE.md Created
- Comprehensive project instructions for AI assistant
- Clarified build order: Engine → Game → Framework
- Established documentation workflow with MASTER_ROADMAP.md as primary tracker
- Defined long-term code philosophy: no bandaids, build for decades
- Extended "When in Doubt" principles (15 guidelines)

### Earth MMO Vision Clarified
- Physical information economy (no copy/paste)
- Stone age → Early space age progression  
- Intuitive crafting discovery (no recipe books)
- Anthropologically accurate gameplay
- **Emergent gameplay, not rules** - Physics enables player stories
- **Organic economy** - Markets form where players choose
- **Ultimate freedom** - Be a nation, bandit, hermit, or merchant
- **One world, your choice** - Thousands online but isolation possible
- **Local communication only** - Voice 50m range, no global chat
- **Player expression** - Dye fabric for flags, write signs, create identity
- **Emergent professions** - Messengers, radio operators, flag makers
- GPU-first thermal dynamics for realistic physics
- Engine must be game-agnostic during current phase

## Honest Metrics
