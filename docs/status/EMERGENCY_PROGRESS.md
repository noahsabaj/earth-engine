## 🔥 Blockers & Risks

1. **Error Handling Strategy** - Need team alignment
2. **DOP Conversion Scope** - 228 files is massive
3. **Test Writing Time** - May need dedicated sprint
4. **Performance Impact** - DOP conversion may initially slow things

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Claiming victory before verification leads to technical debt
- Test coverage should be non-negotiable
- Honest documentation prevents false expectations

---

## 📢 Public Commitment

We commit to updating this document DAILY with:
- Real progress (not aspirational)
- Actual metrics (not estimates)
- Honest blockers (not excuses)

The community deserves transparency.
