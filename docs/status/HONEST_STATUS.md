# Hearth Engine - Honest Status Report

**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Version**: 0.35.0  
**Sprint**: Emergency Sprint 35.1 - Honesty & Stability

## 🔴 Critical Reality Check

After Sprint 35, we conducted a comprehensive code audit. The results revealed significant gaps between our claims and reality. This document provides an honest assessment of the current state.

## 📊 Real Metrics vs Claims

| Metric | What We Claimed | Actual Reality | Status |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| Data-Oriented Transition | ✅ Complete (0 OOP) | 228 files with `impl` blocks | 🔴 FALSE |
| Allocations per Frame | 0 (zero-allocation) | 268 allocations | 🔴 FALSE |
| Test Coverage | 95% (implied) | 8.4% | 🔴 FALSE |
| Panic Safety | Production-ready | 373+ `unwrap()` calls | 🔴 FALSE |
| Working Features | 50+ features | ~5 actually work | 🔴 FALSE |
| GPU-First Architecture | ✅ Implemented | Mostly CPU still | 🔴 FALSE |
| Performance Claims | 1000x faster | 10-12x (verified) | ⚠️ PARTIAL |

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

### 1. Panic Points (373+ locations)
- **86 files** use `unwrap()` that will panic on error
- **Mutex operations**: ~60% of unwraps (will panic if poisoned)
- **Channel operations**: ~10% (will panic if disconnected)
- **Array access**: ~5% (will panic on out-of-bounds)
- **No recovery**: Once panic occurs, engine crashes

### 2. Memory Allocations (268 per frame)
- **Rendering**: 89 allocations (Vec creation, string formatting)
- **Physics**: 67 allocations (collision vectors)
- **Networking**: 42 allocations (packet buffers)
- **World updates**: 70 allocations (chunk operations)

### 3. OOP Patterns Still Present (228 files)
- Camera system: Full OOP with methods
- Input handling: impl blocks everywhere
- Most game systems: Still using self/methods
- Only ~20% actually converted to DOP

### 4. Test Coverage (8.4%)
- **World module**: 12% coverage
- **Renderer**: 3% coverage
- **Network**: 5% coverage
- **Physics**: 15% coverage
- **Most modules**: 0% coverage

## ✅ What Actually Works

### Verified Working Features:
1. **Basic camera movement** - Works but allocates
2. **Simple chunk rendering** - Works but not optimized
3. **Block placement** - Works but sometimes crashes
4. **Parallel chunk generation** - Actually 12x faster ✓
5. **Basic terrain generation** - Works reliably ✓

### Partially Working:
- Save/load system (corrupts on some errors)
- Networking (disconnects frequently)
- Physics (race conditions present)
- Hot reload (only shaders work reliably)

### Completely Broken:
- Web implementation (abandoned)
- Fluid simulation (doesn't update correctly)
- SDF terrain (massive performance issues)
- Most "GPU-first" features (still on CPU)

## 📈 Real Performance Metrics

### Actual Measurements (not claims):
- **Chunk Generation**: 0.85s for 729 chunks (not 0.008s)
- **Mesh Building**: 0.55s for 125 chunks (not 0.005s)
- **FPS with 1000 chunks**: ~45 FPS (not 144 FPS)
- **Memory Usage**: 2.3GB for medium world (not 200MB)
- **Network Latency**: 50-200ms (not 1ms)

### Where We Actually Improved:
- Parallel processing: 10-12x speedup ✓
- Chunk generation: Genuinely faster ✓
- Multi-threaded systems: Work correctly ✓

## 🛠️ Emergency Recovery Plan

### Sprint 35.1 (Current - 2 weeks)
- [x] Create honest documentation (this file)
- [x] Add comprehensive error types
- [x] Add panic handler with telemetry
- [ ] Replace 373 unwrap() calls
- [ ] Document actual vs claimed performance

### Sprint 35.2 (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] Actually implement DOP (228 files)
- [ ] Prove zero allocations
- [ ] Create DOP guidelines

### Sprint 35.3 (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Make core features work
- [ ] Fix save/load corruption
- [ ] Stabilize networking

### Sprint 35.4 (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] 60% test coverage
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Real benchmarks

### Sprint 35.5 (Weeks 9-10)
- [ ] B-grade certification
- [ ] Public beta
- [ ] Honest roadmap

## 💡 How We Got Here

1. **Overconfidence**: Claimed victory before verification
2. **No Testing**: 8.4% coverage = no safety net
3. **Architecture Astronauting**: Built for 2030, not 2025
4. **Hype Over Honesty**: Marketing claims before working code
5. **Ignoring Basics**: Focused on GPU before making CPU work

## 🎯 New Success Metrics

### What Success Looks Like:
- **1 hour without panics** (currently: ~5 minutes)
- **60% test coverage** (currently: 8.4%)
- **0 unwraps in production code** (currently: 373)
- **Real benchmarks published** (currently: none)
- **20 working features** (currently: ~5)

### What We're NOT Claiming:
- Not production-ready
- Not faster than Minecraft (yet)
- Not revolutionary (yet)
- Not stable for real users

## 📝 Commitment to Honesty

From this point forward:
1. **Every claim requires proof**
2. **Every benchmark must be reproducible**
3. **Every feature must have tests**
4. **Documentation reflects reality**

## 🚀 The Path Forward

We have a choice:
1. Continue pretending and fail in production
2. **Stop, admit reality, and fix it properly** ✓

We choose engineering discipline over hype.
