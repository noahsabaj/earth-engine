# The Hearth Engine Manifesto: From Pretense to Performance

## Our North Star 🌟

We are building a **GPU-first voxel engine** that will revolutionize how virtual worlds are created and experienced. This vision remains unchanged and achievable.

## Our Current Reality 🔍

We got drunk on our own vision. We celebrated victories we hadn't earned. We claimed completions that weren't complete. The code audit revealed:
- Our "zero-allocation" engine allocates 268 times per frame
- Our "complete DOP transition" left 228 files untouched
- Our "production-ready" engine panics on bad input
- Our test coverage is 8.4%

**This ends now.**

## Our Principles Going Forward 💪

### 1. Truth Before Triumph
- Every claim must have proof
- Every benchmark must be reproducible
- Every feature must have tests
- Documentation reflects reality, not aspirations

### 2. Working Code > Feature Count
- 1 working feature > 10 broken features
- Stability > Innovation (for now)
- Complete what we start
- No moving to Sprint N+1 until Sprint N actually works

### 3. Engineering Discipline
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Continuous Integration that actually blocks bad code
- Code review that asks "where's the test?"
- Benchmarks before performance claims

### 4. Data-Oriented Means Data-Oriented
- No `self`, no `impl`, no methods
- Data transformations, not object mutations
- Cache-friendly, GPU-friendly, human-friendly
- If it allocates in the hot path, it's wrong

### 5. The User is Sacred
- They deserve honesty about capabilities
- They deserve stability over features
- They deserve documentation that helps
- They deserve an engine that works

## Our Commitment 🤝

For the next 10 weeks (Emergency Sprints 35.1-35.5):

**We will:**
- Fix every panic path
- Test every claim
- Document every API
- Benchmark every optimization
- Be honest about everything

**We won't:**
- Add new features
- Make unverified claims
- Skip tests to go faster
- Compromise on quality

## The Way Forward 🚀

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
Make it work. Make it stable. Make it honest.

### Phase 2: Performance (After B-Grade)
Make it fast. Make it efficient. Make it scale.

### Phase 3: Innovation (After A-Grade)
Make it revolutionary. Make it change the world.

## Our Daily Questions ❓

Before every commit, ask:
1. **Does this make something actually work?**
2. **Can I prove it works with a test?**
3. **Am I being honest about what this does?**
4. **Would I trust this in production?**

## Our Metrics of Success 📊

Success is not:
- Lines of code written
- Features claimed
- Sprints "completed"

Success is:
- Hours without panics
- Tests that pass
- Benchmarks that prove
- Users who build with us

## The Dream Lives 💫

The vision of a GPU-first voxel engine that enables unprecedented virtual worlds is **still alive**. We're just being honest about the journey.

An A+ vision with B-grade execution beats D-grade execution every time.

## The Pledge 📜

*We pledge to build an engine that:*
- *Works before it amazes*
- *Tells the truth before it makes claims*
- *Serves users before it serves our ego*
- *Delivers reality before it promises dreams*

## The Rally Cry 📣

**"From Pretense to Performance!"**

Every day, we choose:
- Tests over talk
- Proof over promises
- Stability over speed
- Honesty over hype

## Join Us 🤲

If you believe in:
- Radical honesty in engineering
- Building foundations before castles
- Proving before proclaiming
- Working code over working titles

Then help us build Hearth Engine the right way.

*"The best engine in the world is the one that actually runs."*

**Together, we will build something real.**
