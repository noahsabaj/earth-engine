# Examples Documentation

This directory contains code examples demonstrating correct Data-Oriented Programming patterns in the Hearth Engine.

## Purpose

- Show correct DOP patterns in practice
- Provide working code examples
- Demonstrate system integration
- Illustrate performance-optimal patterns
- Serve as templates for new development

## What Belongs Here

- Complete working examples
- DOP pattern demonstrations
- System integration examples
- Performance optimization examples
- Common use case implementations
- Anti-pattern examples (what NOT to do)

## What Doesn't Belong Here

- API reference documentation (see `/docs/api/`)
- Theoretical explanations (see `/docs/technical/`)
- Performance benchmarks (see `/docs/performance/`)
- Test code (see `/docs/testing/`)

## Example Categories

### Basic Patterns
- Buffer creation and management
- Kernel implementation
- Data transformation pipelines
- GPU compute dispatch

### Integration Examples
- Multi-system coordination
- Network-physics integration
- Render-world synchronization

### Performance Examples
