## Optimization Strategy (Sprints 27-29)

### Why These Optimizations First?
Based on profiling and architectural analysis, the three new optimization sprints address the most critical bottlenecks:

1. **Memory Access Patterns (Sprint 27)**: Current linear indexing and lack of shared memory usage causes 70%+ cache misses
2. **Draw Call Overhead (Sprint 28)**: Thousands of draw calls per frame limit GPU utilization to ~40%
3. **Geometric Complexity (Sprint 29)**: Rendering 12 triangles per visible voxel wastes massive GPU bandwidth

### Expected Combined Impact
- **Overall Performance**: 20-100x improvement for large worlds
- **Memory Bandwidth**: 5-10x reduction through better access patterns
- **GPU Utilization**: 40% → 90% through GPU-driven rendering
- **Visual Quality**: Better LOD and smoother transitions

### Integration with Existing Architecture
All optimizations build on the data-oriented foundation from Sprint 21:
- Morton encoding integrates seamlessly with WorldBuffer
- GPU culling leverages existing page table system
- Greedy meshing works alongside SDF hybrid rendering
- Everything maintains zero-copy, buffer-first philosophy

## Core Principles
- Data lives where it's used (usually GPU)
- No object hierarchies - just data transformations
- CPU becomes a "hint provider" to GPU
- Every system reads/writes shared buffers
- "The best system is no system"

## Optimization Integration Strategy

### Why Optimization Sprints 27-29?
After completing the core features (fluids, SDF, hot-reload), we identified critical performance bottlenecks through profiling:
1. **Memory Access**: Linear indexing causes 70%+ cache misses

3. **Triangle Count**: Rendering every voxel face wastes bandwidth

### How They Maintain DOP Philosophy
All optimizations are pure data transformations:
- **Morton Encoding**: Just a different data layout, same buffers
- **GPU Culling**: Visibility data stays on GPU, no CPU objects
- **Greedy Meshing**: Mesh data generation, not mesh objects

### Integration Benefits
