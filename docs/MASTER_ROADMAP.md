# Earth Engine Master Roadmap

## 🚨 Emergency Update (Post-Sprint 35)
After completing Sprint 35, a comprehensive code audit revealed significant gaps between our claims and reality. We have inserted Emergency Sprints 35.1-35.5 (10 weeks) to address critical issues before continuing with Sprint 36+. See [Emergency Sprint Series](#emergency-sprint-series-351-355) below.

**Current Focus**: Making things actually work, not adding new features.

## Development Strategy
- Develop in WSL Ubuntu environment for faster development
- Copy files to Windows C: drive when complete for GPU testing
- Focus on thread-safe architecture and concurrent processing
- Data-oriented design philosophy from Sprint 17 onward
- **NEW**: Engineering discipline and honest metrics from Sprint 35.1 onward

## Project Evolution Note
At Sprint 13, the project pivoted from traditional game features to high-performance parallelization and data-oriented architecture. The original Sprint 13-15 plans (Audio, Advanced Features, Performance) were replaced with a focus on revolutionary performance gains.

At Sprint 35.1, the project pivoted again from feature development to engineering discipline after discovering most claimed features don't actually work.

## 🚨 Emergency Sprint Series (35.1-35.5)

After Sprint 35, a comprehensive code audit revealed critical gaps between claims and reality. This 10-week emergency sprint series focuses on engineering discipline and making things actually work.

### Sprint 35.1 Update Summary
**Sprint 35.1 has been completed with partial success.** While significant infrastructure was established (error handling, panic logging, honest documentation), core stability issues remain. The engine still has 171 unwrap() calls that can panic, 181 compilation errors, and 875 warnings. This represents meaningful progress (54% unwrap reduction) but falls short of the zero-panic stability goal.

**Key Achievement**: Established methodology for brutal honesty in progress assessment. No more aspirational completion claims.

### Sprint 35.1: Emergency Honesty & Stability 🟡
**Status**: Partially Complete
**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Objective**: Stop the bleeding - remove all panic points and document reality

#### Reality Check - What Was Actually Accomplished:
- ✅ Created comprehensive error handling system (60+ variants)
- ✅ Added panic handler with telemetry (logs/panic.log)
- ✅ Established brutal honesty approach in documentation
- ⚠️ **Partially Fixed Unwraps**: 171 unwrap() calls remain (down from ~373)
- ⚠️ **Compilation Issues**: 181 errors, 875 warnings still present
- ❌ **Unsafe Documentation**: 17 files with unsafe blocks, documentation incomplete
- ❌ **Bounds Checking**: Minimal progress on array access safety

#### Evidence-Based Progress Assessment:
**Grade: D+ (Partial Progress, But Core Problems Remain)**

The sprint made meaningful infrastructure progress but failed to achieve the core stability objectives. Multiple completion claims in documentation were found to be aspirational rather than factual.

#### What Actually Works Now:
- Error infrastructure exists and is comprehensive
- Panic handler will log crashes (but won't prevent them)
- Foundation for proper error handling is established
- Honest assessment methodology implemented

#### What Still Doesn't Work:
- **171 unwrap() calls** across 47 files can still panic the engine
- **181 compilation errors** prevent clean builds
- **875 warnings** indicate widespread code quality issues
- Array access lacks bounds checking - buffer overflows possible
- Unsafe code lacks proper safety documentation

#### Success Metrics (Actual vs Target):
- ❌ Zero panics in 60-minute runtime (171 unwraps remain)
- ❌ All unwrap() replaced (54% reduction achieved)
- ✅ Honest documentation published
- ❌ Clean compilation (181 errors remain)

#### Key Lessons Learned:
1. **Document Reality, Not Aspirations**: Multiple previous "completion" claims were false
2. **Infrastructure ≠ Implementation**: Error types don't fix unwrap() calls
3. **Verification Required**: Always check actual metrics, not documentation claims
4. **Incremental Progress**: 54% unwrap reduction is meaningful, even if incomplete
5. **Technical Debt is Real**: 875 warnings indicate years of accumulated issues

### Sprint 35.2: DOP Reality Check 🔜
**Status**: Planning (Adjusted based on 35.1 reality)
**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Objective**: Actually complete the data-oriented transition **AFTER** fixing 35.1 stability issues

#### Critical Dependencies from Sprint 35.1:
- **Must fix 181 compilation errors first** - Can't do DOP conversion on broken code
- **Must finish unwrap() replacement** - 171 calls still remain
- **Must address unsafe documentation** - 17 files need safety comments

#### Adjusted Deliverables:
- [ ] **Complete Sprint 35.1 work**: Fix remaining 171 unwraps, 181 errors
- [ ] Convert highest-priority OOP files to DOP (not all 228)
- [ ] Focus on hot-path performance files first

## 🔥 ROADMAP RESTRUCTURE (Post-Reality Check)

**CRITICAL DECISION**: After honest assessment, many "completed" sprints need consolidation work before adding new features. Following CLAUDE.md principles: **"NO BANDAIDS"**, **"Build for decades"**, **"Kaizen over revolution"**.

### Phase 1: Foundation Consolidation (12 weeks)

### Sprint 36: Zero-Panic Foundation 🔧

The original Sprint 36+ features remain in backlog but are **deferred until foundation is proven stable**.

## 📊 Updated Progress Assessment

### Current Reality (Post-Restructure):
- **Foundation Quality**: D+ (needs major work)
- **Working Core Features**: ~8 (player movement broken, spawn broken, save/load risky)
- **DOP Transition**: ~25% (228 OOP files remain)  
- **Panic Safety**: 65% (131 unwrap() calls remain)
- **Test Coverage**: 8.4% (needs 60%+ for stability)

### After Foundation Consolidation (Sprints 36-40):
- **Foundation Quality**: B+ (solid, extensible base)
- **Working Core Features**: 20+ (all basics work reliably)
- **DOP Transition**: 80%+ (core systems genuinely DOP)
- **Panic Safety**: 100% (zero unwrap() in production)
- **Test Coverage**: 60%+ (regression protection)

### Version 1.0 Timeline:
- **Current to Foundation**: 5 months (Sprints 36-40)
- **Foundation to 1.0**: 12+ months (feature development on stable base)
- **Total**: ~18 months for genuine 1.0 release

## 🔄 RESTRUCTURE RATIONALE

This roadmap restructure follows CLAUDE.md principles and addresses critical gaps:

### Why This Change Is Necessary:
1. **"NO BANDAIDS"** - Current approach builds advanced features on broken basics
2. **"Build for decades"** - Foundation must be stable before adding complexity  
3. **"Kaizen over revolution"** - Incremental progress beats revolutionary claims
4. **"Extensibility without breaking"** - Can't extend what crashes or corrupts data

### What Previous "Completed" Sprints Actually Need:
- **Sprint 3 (Player Mechanics)**: Player movement currently broken
- **Sprint 6 (Lighting)**: GPU lighting claimed but still CPU-bound  
- **Sprint 11 (Save System)**: Save/load causes corruption
- **Sprint 17-35**: Many DOP/GPU claims unverified

### Engineering Discipline Established:
- Every deliverable requires proof/benchmarks
- No "completed" claims without working examples
- Focus on 2-5x improvements over 100x claims
- Test coverage required for stability claims

## 🚨 DEFERRED ADVANCED FEATURES

The following ambitious features are moved to **Phase 4** (post-1.0) until foundation proves stable:

## Optimization Strategy (Sprints 27-29)

### Why These Optimizations First?
Based on profiling and architectural analysis, the three new optimization sprints address the most critical bottlenecks:

1. **Memory Access Patterns (Sprint 27)**: Current linear indexing and lack of shared memory usage causes 70%+ cache misses
2. **Draw Call Overhead (Sprint 28)**: Thousands of draw calls per frame limit GPU utilization to ~40%
3. **Geometric Complexity (Sprint 29)**: Rendering 12 triangles per visible voxel wastes massive GPU bandwidth

### Expected Combined Impact
- **Overall Performance**: 20-100x improvement for large worlds
- **Memory Bandwidth**: 5-10x reduction through better access patterns
- **GPU Utilization**: 40% → 90% through GPU-driven rendering
- **Visual Quality**: Better LOD and smoother transitions

### Integration with Existing Architecture
All optimizations build on the data-oriented foundation from Sprint 21:
- Morton encoding integrates seamlessly with WorldBuffer
- GPU culling leverages existing page table system
- Greedy meshing works alongside SDF hybrid rendering
- Everything maintains zero-copy, buffer-first philosophy

## Performance Summary (Honest Assessment)

| System | Original | Parallel (Verified) | Claimed | Actual (Sprint 35.1) | Emergency Target |
|--------|----------|-------------------|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Chunk Generation | 10.40s | 0.85s ✓ | 0.008s | 0.85s | 0.1s |
| Mesh Building | 2.89s | 0.55s ✓ | 0.005s | 0.55s | 0.05s |
| Lighting | N/A | 0.30s ✓ | 0.003s | 0.30s | 0.03s |
| Unwrap() Calls | 373 | 373 | 0 | 171 | 0 |
| Compilation Errors | Unknown | Unknown | 0 | 181 | 0 |
| Compilation Warnings | Unknown | Unknown | 0 | 875 | <100 |
| Unsafe Blocks | 17 | 17 | 0 undoc | 17 undoc | 0 undoc |
| Test Coverage | 0% | 0% | 95% | 8.4% | 60% |
| OOP Files | 350+ | 350+ | 0 | 228 | 0 |
| Working Features | 0 | 5 | 50+ | ~8 | 20+ |

**Reality Check**: 
- ✓ = Actually verified and working
- Parallel improvements from Sprints 13-16 are real and impressive
- Data-oriented claims were largely aspirational
- Sprint 35.1 made meaningful progress but core stability issues remain
- **181 compilation errors and 875 warnings** indicate significant technical debt
- **171 unwrap() calls** mean the engine still panics frequently
- Emergency sprints focus on making claimed features actually work

## Core Principles
- Data lives where it's used (usually GPU)
- No object hierarchies - just data transformations
- CPU becomes a "hint provider" to GPU
- Every system reads/writes shared buffers
- "The best system is no system"

## Optimization Integration Strategy

### Why Optimization Sprints 27-29?
After completing the core features (fluids, SDF, hot-reload), we identified critical performance bottlenecks through profiling:
1. **Memory Access**: Linear indexing causes 70%+ cache misses
2. **Draw Calls**: Thousands per frame limit GPU efficiency
3. **Triangle Count**: Rendering every voxel face wastes bandwidth

### How They Maintain DOP Philosophy
All optimizations are pure data transformations:
- **Morton Encoding**: Just a different data layout, same buffers
- **GPU Culling**: Visibility data stays on GPU, no CPU objects
- **Greedy Meshing**: Mesh data generation, not mesh objects

### Integration Benefits
- Build on existing WorldBuffer architecture
- Zero new abstractions or object hierarchies
