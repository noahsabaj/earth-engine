# Earth Engine Master Roadmap

## 🚨 Engineering Discipline Phase (Sprints 36-40)
After completing Sprint 35, a comprehensive code audit revealed significant gaps between our claims and reality. Sprints 36-40 focus on engineering discipline and making things actually work rather than adding new features.

**Current Focus**: Sprint 39 - Core Systems Stabilization (addressing the 0.8 FPS performance crisis).

## Development Strategy
- Develop in WSL Ubuntu environment for faster development
- Copy files to Windows C: drive when complete for GPU testing
- Focus on thread-safe architecture and concurrent processing
- Data-oriented design philosophy from Sprint 17 onward
- **NEW**: Engineering discipline and honest metrics from Sprint 36 onward

## Project Evolution Note
At Sprint 13, the project pivoted from traditional game features to high-performance parallelization and data-oriented architecture. The original Sprint 13-15 plans (Audio, Advanced Features, Performance) were replaced with a focus on revolutionary performance gains.

At Sprint 36, the project pivoted again from feature development to engineering discipline after discovering most claimed features don't actually work.

- [ ] Connect stable networking with save/load
- [ ] Fix spawn system integration with chunk generation

- Save/load works reliably over 100+ cycles

### Phase 2: Quality & Performance (8 weeks)

### Phase 3: Feature Expansion (Only After Foundation Is Solid)

**NOTE**: Advanced features like ray tracing, mesh shaders, GPU-to-GPU networking will be reconsidered ONLY after:
- Zero-panic runtime achieved
- Core systems working reliably  
- DOP transition actually complete
- 60%+ test coverage maintained
- Engineering discipline established

The original Sprint 36+ features remain in backlog but are **deferred until foundation is proven stable**.

## 📊 Updated Progress Assessment

### Current Reality (Post-Restructure):
- **Foundation Quality**: D+ (needs major work)
- **Working Core Features**: ~8 (player movement broken, spawn broken, save/load risky)
- **DOP Transition**: ~25% (228 OOP files remain)  
- **Panic Safety**: 65% (131 unwrap() calls remain)
- **Test Coverage**: 8.4% (needs 60%+ for stability)

### After Foundation Consolidation (Sprints 36-40):
- **Foundation Quality**: B+ (solid, extensible base)
- **Working Core Features**: 20+ (all basics work reliably)
- **DOP Transition**: 80%+ (core systems genuinely DOP)
- **Panic Safety**: 100% (zero unwrap() in production)
- **Test Coverage**: 60%+ (regression protection)

### Version 1.0 Timeline:
- **Current to Foundation**: 5 months (Sprints 36-40)
- **Foundation to 1.0**: 12+ months (feature development on stable base)
- **Total**: ~18 months for genuine 1.0 release

## 🔄 RESTRUCTURE RATIONALE

This roadmap restructure follows CLAUDE.md principles and addresses critical gaps:

### Why This Change Is Necessary:
1. **"NO BANDAIDS"** - Current approach builds advanced features on broken basics
2. **"Build for decades"** - Foundation must be stable before adding complexity  
3. **"Kaizen over revolution"** - Incremental progress beats revolutionary claims
4. **"Extensibility without breaking"** - Can't extend what crashes or corrupts data

### What Previous "Completed" Sprints Actually Need:
- **Sprint 3 (Player Mechanics)**: Player movement currently broken
- **Sprint 6 (Lighting)**: GPU lighting claimed but still CPU-bound  
- **Sprint 11 (Save System)**: Save/load causes corruption
- **Sprint 17-35**: Many DOP/GPU claims unverified

### Engineering Discipline Established:
- Every deliverable requires proof/benchmarks
- No "completed" claims without working examples
- Focus on 2-5x improvements over 100x claims
- Test coverage required for stability claims

## 🚨 DEFERRED ADVANCED FEATURES

The following ambitious features are moved to **Phase 4** (post-1.0) until foundation proves stable:

### Sprint 41+: HybridGPUGrid - GPU-to-GPU Networking

## Optimization Strategy (Sprints 27-29)

### Why These Optimizations First?
Based on profiling and architectural analysis, the three new optimization sprints address the most critical bottlenecks:

1. **Memory Access Patterns (Sprint 27)**: Current linear indexing and lack of shared memory usage causes 70%+ cache misses
2. **Draw Call Overhead (Sprint 28)**: Thousands of draw calls per frame limit GPU utilization to ~40%
3. **Geometric Complexity (Sprint 29)**: Rendering 12 triangles per visible voxel wastes massive GPU bandwidth

### Expected Combined Impact
- **Overall Performance**: 20-100x improvement for large worlds
- **Memory Bandwidth**: 5-10x reduction through better access patterns
- **GPU Utilization**: 40% → 90% through GPU-driven rendering
- **Visual Quality**: Better LOD and smoother transitions

### Integration with Existing Architecture
All optimizations build on the data-oriented foundation from Sprint 21:
- Morton encoding integrates seamlessly with WorldBuffer
- GPU culling leverages existing page table system
- Greedy meshing works alongside SDF hybrid rendering
- Everything maintains zero-copy, buffer-first philosophy

## Performance Summary (Honest Assessment)

| System | Original | Parallel (Verified) | Claimed | Actual (Sprint 35.1) | Emergency Target |
|--------|----------|-------------------|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Chunk Generation | 10.40s | 0.85s ✓ | 0.008s | 0.85s | 0.1s |
| Mesh Building | 2.89s | 0.55s ✓ | 0.005s | 0.55s | 0.05s |
| Lighting | N/A | 0.30s ✓ | 0.003s | 0.30s | 0.03s |
| Unwrap() Calls | 373 | 373 | 0 | 171 | 0 |
| Compilation Errors | Unknown | Unknown | 0 | 181 | 0 |
| Compilation Warnings | Unknown | Unknown | 0 | 875 | <100 |
| Unsafe Blocks | 17 | 17 | 0 undoc | 17 undoc | 0 undoc |
| Test Coverage | 0% | 0% | 95% | 8.4% | 60% |
| OOP Files | 350+ | 350+ | 0 | 228 | 0 |
| Working Features | 0 | 5 | 50+ | ~8 | 20+ |

**Reality Check**: 
- ✓ = Actually verified and working
- Parallel improvements from Sprints 13-16 are real and impressive
- Data-oriented claims were largely aspirational
- Sprint 35.1 made meaningful progress but core stability issues remain
- **181 compilation errors and 875 warnings** indicate significant technical debt
- **171 unwrap() calls** mean the engine still panics frequently
- Emergency sprints focus on making claimed features actually work

- **Parallelism**: GPU compute shaders primary, CPU secondary
- **Memory**: Unified buffer architecture
- **Networking**: Buffer-based protocols (WebTransport)
- **Platform**: Native (Windows/Linux/Mac) + Web (WASM)

## Core Principles
- Data lives where it's used (usually GPU)
- No object hierarchies - just data transformations
- CPU becomes a "hint provider" to GPU
- Every system reads/writes shared buffers
- "The best system is no system"

## Optimization Integration Strategy

### Why Optimization Sprints 27-29?
After completing the core features (fluids, SDF, hot-reload), we identified critical performance bottlenecks through profiling:
1. **Memory Access**: Linear indexing causes 70%+ cache misses
2. **Draw Calls**: Thousands per frame limit GPU efficiency
3. **Triangle Count**: Rendering every voxel face wastes bandwidth

### How They Maintain DOP Philosophy
All optimizations are pure data transformations:
- **Morton Encoding**: Just a different data layout, same buffers
- **GPU Culling**: Visibility data stays on GPU, no CPU objects
- **Greedy Meshing**: Mesh data generation, not mesh objects

### Integration Benefits
- Build on existing WorldBuffer architecture
- Zero new abstractions or object hierarchies
- Each optimization multiplies previous gains
- Combined effect: 20-100x total performance improvement
