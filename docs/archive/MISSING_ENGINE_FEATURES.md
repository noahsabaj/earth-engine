# Missing Engine Features for Complete Voxel Engine

After Sprint 38, these engine systems are still needed for a complete voxel engine. All must follow data-oriented principles.

## Already Planned (Sprints 39-45)

These features were added to MASTER_ROADMAP.md based on Claude's excellent suggestions:

### Sprint 39: GPU-Driven Audio System
- Voxel-based sound propagation using compute shaders
- Spatial audio with occlusion through blocks
- 1000+ simultaneous 3D sounds
- Perfect integration with voxel grid

### Sprint 40: GPU Flow Field Pathfinding  
- Flow fields better than A* for massive agents
- 10,000+ agents simultaneously
- Reusable for fluid flow directions
- Natural hierarchy from voxel grid

### Sprint 41: Asset Pipeline & Tools
- Essential before 1.0 release
- GPU-ready asset formats
- Voxel model importers
- Direct to buffer conversion

### Sprint 42: Data-Oriented Animation System
- Skeletal animation on GPU
- IK solvers and procedural animation
- Bones as transform buffers
- No state machines - data-driven

### Sprint 43: Post-Processing Pipeline
- TAA, bloom, tone mapping
- Single unified compute kernel
- Screen-space effects
- No separate passes

### Sprint 44: Debug & Profiling Overlay
- GPU performance visualization
- Zero overhead when disabled
- Integrated with renderer
- Debug data stays on GPU

### Sprint 45: Engine 1.0 Release
- Final polish and certification
- API stability guarantee
- Performance audit
- Ready for framework layer

## Additional Features to Consider (Post-1.0)

### Advanced Voxel Features
- Voxel rotation/orientation (45Â° angles, slopes)
- Sub-voxel details (microblocks)
- Connected textures
- Voxel metadata storage
- Custom voxel shapes

### Advanced Physics
- Voxel destruction/fracture
- Soft body dynamics on GPU
- Rope/chain simulation
- Physics LOD system

### UI System
- Data-oriented immediate mode GUI
- GPU-accelerated text rendering
- Signed distance field fonts
- One draw call per layer

### Procedural Systems
- L-system vegetation on GPU
- Structure generation
- Cave system generator
- Real-time preview

### Scripting/Modding
- WASM modules for gameplay
- Buffer modification API
- Hot-reload scripting
- Sandboxed execution

## Why This Order?

1. **Audio/Pathfinding/Assets** (39-41): Essential for any game
2. **Animation/Post/Debug** (42-44): Core engine features
3. **1.0 Release** (45): Engine complete and production-ready
4. **Post-1.0**: Nice-to-haves and advanced features

## Key Principles Maintained

- **No Objects**: Everything is buffers + compute shaders
- **GPU-First**: Even audio and pathfinding on GPU
- **Zero Copy**: Shared buffers between systems
- **Data-Oriented**: Pure data transformations

After Sprint 45, the engine will be complete and ready for the framework layer!
