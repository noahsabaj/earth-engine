# Emergency Sprint Series 35.1-35.5: Operation Reality

## ðŸš¨ THE WAKE-UP CALL ðŸš¨

After Sprint 35's claims of "complete DOP transition" and "zero-allocation architecture", a comprehensive code audit revealed:

- **228 files** still have OOP patterns
- **268 allocations** per frame (not zero!)
- **8.4% test coverage** (abysmal)
- **Zero benchmarks** backing performance claims
- Most "completed" features don't actually work

## ðŸ“‹ THE 10-WEEK RECOVERY PLAN

### Sprint 35.1: Emergency Honesty & Stability (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Stop panics, admit reality
- Replace all unwrap() with Result<T, E>
- Create honest documentation
- Establish real metrics

### Sprint 35.2: DOP Reality Check (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal**: Actually do the DOP transition
- Convert 10 core modules to true DOP
- Document patterns
- Verify zero allocations

### Sprint 35.3: Core Systems Implementation (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Make basic features work
- Implement game loop
- Add player controller
- Enable save/load

### Sprint 35.4: Integration & Testing (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal**: Connect systems, prove they work
- Integrate all systems
- 60% test coverage
- Establish benchmarks

### Sprint 35.5: B-Grade Certification (Weeks 9-10)
**Goal**: Achieve "solid B-grade engine" status
- Document everything
- Create example games
- Publish honest metrics

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS METRICS

### From (Current State):
- Vision: A+ (good ideas)
- Execution: D (broken, incomplete)
- Honesty: F (claims don't match code)

### To (After Emergency Sprints):
- Vision: A+ (keeping current vision)
- Execution: B (solid, working basics)
- Honesty: A+ (radical transparency)

## ðŸ’ª THE COMMITMENT

We commit to:

1. **NO MORE FALSE CLAIMS** - Every claim backed by evidence
2. **WORKING CODE OVER FEATURE COUNT** - Fewer features that actually work
3. **TESTS BEFORE BOASTS** - Prove it works before claiming it
4. **PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY** - Real metrics, updated daily

## ðŸ“Š TRACKING PROGRESS

Daily updates at: `/docs/EMERGENCY_PROGRESS.md`

Key metrics:
- Files with OOP: 228 â†’ 0
- Allocations/frame: 268 â†’ 0
- Test coverage: 8.4% â†’ 60%
- Unwrap() count: 500+ â†’ 0
- Working features: ~5 â†’ 20+

## ðŸ”¥ THE RALLY CRY

**"From Pretense to Performance"**

We built castles in the sky. Now we're building foundations in the earth. The vision remains extraordinary - we're just being honest about the journey.

Every commit during these emergency sprints should ask:
1. Does this make something ACTUALLY work?
2. Can we PROVE it works?
3. Are we being HONEST about what it does?

## ðŸ“… TIMELINE

- **Start Date**: Immediately after Sprint 35
- **End Date**: 10 weeks later
- **Review Cycle**: Daily standups on progress
- **Success Criteria**: B-grade working engine

## ðŸš€ THE PROMISE

After these emergency sprints, Hearth Engine will be:
- **Stable**: No panics, no crashes
- **Honest**: Claims match reality
- **Functional**: Core features actually work
- **Documented**: APIs, examples, guides
- **Tested**: 60% coverage, benchmarks

Not the "world's best engine" yet - but a solid foundation built on truth instead of hype.
