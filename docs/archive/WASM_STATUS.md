# Hearth Engine WASM Status

## Current State (Sprint 22 - Abandoned)

### ‚õî Web Implementation Removed

The web implementation has been completely removed from the project. After analysis, it was determined that:
- It wasn't using any Rust engine code
- It wasn't truly GPU-first as claimed
- It wasn't working despite extensive debugging
- It provided no value to the main engine

### ‚úÖ What Works

1. **Minimal WASM Demo**
   - Located in `wasm-demo/` directory
   - Successfully compiles with `wasm-pack`
   - Generates working .wasm and .js files

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work

1. **Full Engine Compilation**
   - Many dependencies incompatible with WASM (tokio, compression libs, file I/O)
   - Mutable borrowing conflicts with Arc<T> patterns
   - Platform-specific code throughout codebase
   - ~150+ compilation errors when building for WASM

2. **Missing Web APIs**
   - WebTransport not available in web-sys
   - Some WebGPU features missing
   - No SharedArrayBuffer support detection

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Test

#### Option 1: Minimal WASM Demo
```bash
# Build WASM demo
cd wasm-demo
wasm-pack build --target web
```

#### Option 2: Try Full Build (Will Fail)
```bash
# This shows the compilation errors
wasm-pack build --target web --features web --no-default-features
```

### üìã Next Steps

1. **Short Term** - Expand minimal demo
   - Add basic voxel rendering
   - Implement camera controls
   - Show performance stats

2. **Medium Term** - Refactor for WASM
   - Replace Arc<T> with RefCell<T> for interior mutability
   - Add conditional compilation throughout
   - Create WASM-specific implementations

3. **Long Term** - Full WASM Support
   - Abstract all platform-specific code
   - Create web-compatible alternatives for all dependencies
   - Implement proper WebGPU integration
   - Add WebTransport when available

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Challenges

The Hearth Engine was designed as a native application with assumptions about:
- Multi-threading (not available in WASM)
- File system access
- Network I/O
- Memory mapping
- Platform-specific optimizations

A proper WASM port requires:
- Single-threaded architecture (or Web Workers)
- IndexedDB for persistence
- Fetch API for networking
- ArrayBuffer for memory operations
- Browser-specific optimizations

### üìä Estimated Effort

- Minimal working demo: ‚úÖ Complete
- Basic voxel renderer: ~1 week
- Camera & controls: ~1 week  
- Full engine port: 2-3 months
