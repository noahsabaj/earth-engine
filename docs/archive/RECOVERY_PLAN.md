# Earth Engine Recovery Plan

## The Situation

A comprehensive audit after Sprint 35 revealed critical discrepancies between our claims and reality:

- **Claimed**: "Complete DOP transition" | **Reality**: 228 files still have OOP patterns
- **Claimed**: "Zero allocations" | **Reality**: 268 allocations per frame
- **Claimed**: "Production ready" | **Reality**: 8.4% test coverage, panics everywhere

## The Decision

We face a choice:
1. Continue pretending and fail spectacularly in production
2. Stop, admit reality, and fix it properly

**We choose honesty and engineering discipline.**

## The Plan: Emergency Sprints 35.1-35.5

### 10 weeks to go from D to B execution:

**Weeks 1-2** (Sprint 35.1): Emergency Stabilization
- Remove all panic points
- Document actual state
- Establish honest metrics

**Weeks 3-4** (Sprint 35.2): Real DOP Transition
- Actually remove OOP patterns
- Prove zero allocations
- Document the patterns

**Weeks 5-6** (Sprint 35.3): Core Features
- Game loop that works
- Player that can play
- World that persists

**Weeks 7-8** (Sprint 35.4): Integration
- Connect the systems
- Test everything
- Benchmark reality

**Weeks 9-10** (Sprint 35.5): B-Grade Certification
- Document all APIs
- Create examples
- Prove it works

## The Metrics

We will track daily:
- Panic count (500+ → 0)
- Test coverage (8.4% → 60%)
- Working features (5 → 20+)
- Allocations/frame (268 → 0)

## The Promise

After 10 weeks:
- **It won't be perfect** - but it will work
- **It won't be the fastest** - but it won't crash
- **It won't have every feature** - but existing features will be real

## The Alternative

Without this intervention:
- First production deployment will fail catastrophically
- Community trust will be destroyed
- Years of work will be wasted

## The Ask

Give us 10 weeks of disciplined engineering:
- No new features
- No hype claims
- Just making things work

## The Outcome

A B-grade engine is infinitely better than an A+ idea that crashes.
