# Comprehensive Diagnostic Logging Implementation

## Overview

Added comprehensive diagnostic logging throughout the terrain rendering pipeline to provide visibility into the GPU→CPU→GPU terrain flow and help debug performance issues and breakdowns.

## Components Enhanced

### 1. GPU Terrain Generation (`src/world_gpu/terrain_generator.rs`)

**Enhanced with:**
- **Timing Information**: Measures buffer preparation, bind group creation, and compute dispatch times
- **Spatial Context**: Logs chunk positions being generated, batch bounds, and world coordinates  
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates chunks/second and voxels/second generation rates
- **Resource Usage**: Logs buffer sizes, workgroup counts, and GPU memory usage
- **Error Handling**: Clear logging for failed operations with context

**Key Log Prefixes:** `[GPU_TERRAIN]`

**Example Output:**
```
[GPU_TERRAIN] Starting GPU terrain generation for 5 chunks
[GPU_TERRAIN] Chunk batch bounds: X(0 to 2), Y(0 to 1), Z(0 to 2)
[GPU_TERRAIN] Performance metrics: 250.3 chunks/sec, 8219776 voxels/sec
```

### 2. CPU Mesh Building (`src/renderer/data_mesh_builder.rs`)

**Enhanced with:**
- **Buffer Pool Management**: Logs buffer acquisition/release, pool usage statistics
- **Mesh Generation Metrics**: Tracks vertex/index counts, faces per block, buffer usage percentages
- **Performance Analysis**: Measures voxels processed per second, generation timing
- **Memory Usage**: Reports vertex and index buffer memory consumption
- **Error Detection**: Proper error handling for buffer full conditions and face generation failures

**Key Log Prefixes:** `[MESH_BUILD]`

**Example Output:**
```
[MESH_BUILD] Chunk ChunkPos { x: 1, y: 0, z: 1 } mesh complete - 1280 non-air blocks → 11776 vertices (29.4% buffer), 17664 indices (29.4% buffer)
[MESH_BUILD] Mesh metrics: 4.6 faces/block, 32768 voxels/sec, generation time: 1.00ms
```

### 3. GPU Rendering (`src/renderer/gpu_driven/gpu_driven_renderer.rs`)

**Enhanced with:**
- **Frame Context**: Logs camera position and rendering context for each frame
- **Instance Management**: Tracks instance uploads, buffer usage, and persistence across frames
- **GPU Command Building**: Times command preparation, culling setup, and buffer uploads
- **Render Performance**: Measures draw calls, triangles rendered, and rendering bandwidth
- **Mesh Upload Diagnostics**: Detailed logging of mesh data uploads to GPU buffers

**Key Log Prefixes:** `[GPU_RENDER]`

**Example Output:**
```
[GPU_RENDER] Beginning frame at camera position (100.0, 50.0, 200.0), yaw: -90.0°, pitch: 0.0°
[GPU_RENDER] Instance upload completed: 5 instances (640 bytes) in 0.12ms
[GPU_RENDER] Render draw completed: 15 draw calls, 5888 triangles in 1.25ms
```

### 4. GPU-CPU Data Transfer (`src/world_gpu/world_buffer.rs`)

**Enhanced with:**
- **Slot Management**: Logs chunk slot allocation, eviction, and buffer usage
- **Upload Operations**: Tracks CPU→GPU uploads with bandwidth calculations and content analysis
- **Readback Operations**: Comprehensive logging of GPU→CPU data extraction with timing
- **Performance Monitoring**: Identifies slow operations and warns about performance issues
- **Data Validation**: Analyzes chunk content (fill percentages, non-air block counts)

**Key Log Prefixes:** `[WORLD_BUFFER]`

**Example Output:**
```
[WORLD_BUFFER] Uploading chunk ChunkPos { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 } to GPU (32768 voxels)
[WORLD_BUFFER] Chunk content: 1280 non-air voxels (3.9% filled)
[WORLD_BUFFER] GPU→CPU readback completed: 15.2 MB/s bandwidth
```

### 5. Camera Spatial Context (`src/camera/data_camera.rs`)

**Enhanced with:**
- **Spatial Diagnostics**: Helper functions to calculate chunk positions, local coordinates, and distances
- **View Context**: Functions to determine chunks within view distance
- **Performance Context**: Logging helpers that include camera position for debugging
- **Context Logging**: Easy-to-use functions for adding spatial context to any operation

**Key Module:** `diagnostics`

**Example Usage:**
```rust
use earth_engine::camera::data_camera::diagnostics;

diagnostics::log_camera_context(&camera, "Terrain Generation");
diagnostics::log_performance_context(&camera, "Mesh Building", 1.5, Some(5));
```

## Log Level Guidelines

- **`INFO`**: Important events, performance metrics, operation completions
- **`DEBUG`**: Detailed timing, buffer operations, spatial coordinates  
- **`WARN`**: Performance issues, resource constraints, recoverable problems
- **`ERROR`**: Failed operations, missing resources, unrecoverable errors

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal Runtime Overhead**: Logging calls are efficient and mostly compile-time
- **Conditional Compilation**: Debug logs can be disabled in release builds
- **Structured Output**: Consistent prefixes make logs easily searchable
- **Batch Logging**: Avoids excessive logging in tight loops

## Usage Examples

### Basic Debugging
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --example your_app
```

### Pipeline-Specific Debugging
```bash
RUST_LOG=earth_engine::world_gpu=debug,earth_engine::renderer=info cargo run
```

### Search for Specific Issues
```bash
cargo run 2>&1 | grep "\[GPU_TERRAIN\]"
cargo run 2>&1 | grep "Performance warning"
```

## Benefits

1. **Issue Isolation**: Quickly identify where in the pipeline problems occur
2. **Performance Analysis**: Detailed metrics for optimization efforts
3. **Spatial Context**: Understand operations in relation to camera/world position  
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Track GPU memory usage, buffer utilization
5. **Development Speed**: Faster debugging and development iteration
