# Spawn Area Pre-generation Fix

## Overview
Fixed multiple issues with the spawn area pre-generation in `parallel_world.rs` that were causing blocking and potential infinite loops.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Chunk Count Mismatch (Cube vs Sphere)
**Problem**: The chunk count calculation was using a cube formula but generating a sphere of chunks.
**Fix**: Updated the calculation to accurately count chunks within a sphere using floating-point radius calculation.

### 2. Blocking Operation
**Problem**: The pregeneration was blocking the main thread with a tight loop.
**Fix**: 
- Created a non-blocking `pregenerate_spawn_area()` that returns a `SpawnGenerationHandle`
- Added a separate `pregenerate_spawn_area_blocking()` for cases where blocking is acceptable
- Generation now happens progressively in batches

### 3. Missing Timeout and Progress Checking
**Problem**: No proper timeout handling, could loop indefinitely.
**Fix**: 
- Added configurable timeout (10 seconds for blocking version)
- Added progress tracking with atomic counters
- Added periodic progress logging

### 4. Unbounded Channels
**Problem**: Using unbounded channels could cause memory issues.
**Fix**: Replaced `unbounded()` with `bounded()` channels, with capacity based on view distance.

### 5. Excessive Radius
**Problem**: Large radius values could generate hundreds of chunks at once.
**Fix**: Limited effective radius to 4 chunks to prevent memory issues.

### 6. Error Handling
**Problem**: No proper error handling for channel operations.
**Fix**: 
- Added `try_send` instead of `send` to avoid panics
- Added proper error logging for full channels
- Return `Result` types from pregeneration functions

## New API

### Non-blocking Generation
```rust
// Start generation and get a handle
let handle = world.pregenerate_spawn_area(spawn_pos, radius)?;

// Check progress
while !handle.is_complete() {
    println!("Progress: {:.1}%", handle.progress_percent());
}
```

### Blocking Generation
```rust
// For initial world setup only
world.pregenerate_spawn_area_blocking(spawn_pos, radius)?;
```

### SpawnGenerationHandle
Provides real-time progress tracking:
- `is_complete()` - Check if generation finished
- `chunks_generated()` - Get current chunk count
- `progress_percent()` - Get progress as percentage
- `elapsed()` - Get time since generation started

## Implementation Details

1. **Progressive Generation**: Chunks are generated in batches of 8 to avoid overwhelming the system
2. **Priority Ordering**: Chunks closest to spawn are generated first
3. **Channel Bounds**: Queue size is `(view_distance * 2 + 1)Â³ * 2` with minimum of 1000
4. **Thread Safety**: Uses atomic operations for progress tracking
5. **No Allocations in Hot Path**: Progress updates use atomic operations, not locks

## Performance Improvements

- Reduced memory usage by limiting concurrent generation
- Better CPU utilization through batch processing
- Non-blocking operation prevents frame drops
- Progressive loading allows game to start faster

## Testing

Created `examples/test_spawn_pregeneration.rs` to verify:
- Non-blocking generation works correctly
- Progress tracking is accurate
- Timeout handling prevents infinite loops
- Performance metrics are properly updated
