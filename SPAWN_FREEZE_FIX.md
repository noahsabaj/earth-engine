# Spawn Area Pre-generation Freeze Fix

## Problem

The application was freezing for 30+ seconds during startup due to an issue with the spawn area pre-generation:

1. **Mismatch in chunk counting**: The `pregenerate_spawn_area` function was waiting for `(2*radius+1)Â³ = 125` chunks (cubic volume), but the actual generation used a spherical radius which only generates 33 chunks.

2. **Infinite wait loop**: This mismatch caused an infinite loop waiting for chunks that would never be generated, eventually timing out after 30 seconds.

3. **Synchronous blocking**: The pre-generation was blocking the main thread during startup.

## Solution

1. **Fixed chunk counting**:
   - Now correctly calculates the expected number of chunks in a sphere
   - Added timeout and stall detection to prevent infinite waits
   - Shows actual progress in console output

2. **Reduced initial radius**:
   - Changed from radius 2 (33 chunks) to radius 1 (7 chunks)
   - Still provides smooth gameplay while reducing startup time

3. **Optimized chunk generation**:
   - Modified `pregenerate_chunks` to generate all chunks immediately in parallel
   - Removed the need for multiple `process_generation_queue` calls

## Files Modified

1. `/src/world/parallel_world.rs`:
   - Fixed `pregenerate_spawn_area` to correctly count spherical chunks
   - Added timeout (30s) and stall detection (1s no progress)
   - Better progress reporting

2. `/src/renderer/gpu_state.rs`:
   - Reduced pre-generation radius from 2 to 1

3. `/src/world/parallel_chunk_manager.rs`:
   - Made `pregenerate_chunks` generate all chunks directly in parallel
   - Removed dependency on asynchronous queue processing for startup

## Performance Impact

- **Before**: 30+ second freeze at startup
- **After**: <1 second for initial chunk generation (7 chunks)
- Chunks continue loading asynchronously as the player moves

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Run the application and observe startup time
2. Check console output for "Pregenerating 7 chunks around spawn..."
3. Verify no freezes or timeouts occur
4. Confirm smooth gameplay after initial load
