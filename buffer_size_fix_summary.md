# Buffer Size Fix Summary

## Problem
- GPU buffer allocation was requesting 2,883,584,000 bytes (2.88 GB)
- GPU maximum buffer size is 2,147,483,648 bytes (2.14 GB)
- Error occurred in "Chunk Vertex Buffer" allocation in MeshBufferManager

## Root Cause
- MeshBufferManager was allocating:
  - 1000 meshes × 65,536 vertices/mesh × 44 bytes/vertex = 2.88 GB
  - This exceeded the GPU's 2.14 GB buffer limit

## Solution Applied
Following DOP principles, reduced buffer allocation sizes:

1. **Reduced vertices per mesh**: 65,536 → 40,000
   - Still provides ample vertices for complex chunk meshes
   - Allows same number of meshes (1000) to be stored

2. **New buffer sizes**:
   - Vertex buffer: 1.64 GB (82% of GPU limit)
   - Index buffer: 0.22 GB (11% of GPU limit)
   - Total: 1.86 GB (well within 2.14 GB limit)

3. **Added logging** to track buffer allocations

## Files Modified
1. `/src/renderer/gpu_driven/gpu_driven_renderer.rs`:
   - Updated MeshBufferManager::new() to use smaller buffers
   - Added calculation comments and logging

2. `/src/renderer/data_mesh_builder.rs`:
   - Updated MAX_VERTICES constant from 65536 to 40000
   - Ensures consistency across the codebase

## Impact
- Buffer allocation will now succeed within GPU limits
- Mesh generation may need to split very large chunks into multiple meshes
- Performance should remain excellent with 40K vertices per mesh
